INTRODUCTION                                    *betterfind*
A very simple plugin that makes Vim's default |find| command into a simple 
fuzzy finder.

* Just use |find| and hit tab to get auto complete. Use `Ctrl-P` and `Ctrl-N`
  to go up and down the list.
* Use `:GFind` or simply `:Gf` to fuzzy find files in your get repository.
